### discourse-no-bump

This plugin prevents users from bumping their own topics. On some higher
traffic forums, if a user doesn't receive replies to their topic they
will reply to themselves (bumping) repeatedly to gain visibility.

- When enabled, a user will need to wait for a different user to reply to
  their topic before they can reply again.

- Staff members can always bump their own topics

### Settings

- `no bump enabled` - set to true to enable the plugin

- `no bump trust level` - users at this trust level (and lower) will not be
  allowed to bump their topics
